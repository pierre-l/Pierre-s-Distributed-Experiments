PDE is a collection of simulated peer-to-peer systems. For now, it consists of:

* a [P2P network simulator](./network_simulator/),
* a [Proof-of-Work blockchain simulation](./pow/).

These are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) and rely on the [Tokio and futures libraries](https://tokio.rs/).

Status
------
This is an experimental project. Everything written here was not written for a production environment. Significant API changes are to be expected in the near future.
